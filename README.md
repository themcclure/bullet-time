# Aillio Bullet R1, powered by _Ballistics_

I wanted to process all the data that the RoasTime and Roast.World collects about all 
the coffee roasting.
I wrote this module to automatically generate

## Applications
Here are the applications in use in this repo that make use of the proto-module "ballistics".

### Load One (`load_one.py`)
This loads one roast, for quick checking and debugging.
Design to be in an interactive shell so that the loaded objects (and raw JSON) can 
be explored interactively.

TODO:
- take args for which roast (by number, name?)
- take option to load a bean

### B

## Ballistics Module
This is where I have wrapped up the module with some utility programs.

## TODO:

#### Ballistics Module:
- There are many things to do!
- Additional commentary from other sources to be brought in and added to the Contentful
content
- Make up labels in two sizes, at high resolution
- Save to md/Contentful/other
- generate profile graph

#### Applications
- There are many things to do!
- .env.placeholder to show all the options that can be overridden
- Cupping scores
- Reviews from drinkers
- Aggregate scores from roasts to the bean as a whole
- Tasting notes (keyword tagging a la Untapped?)
- Assembling blend recipes, harking to the component beans

## Releases
Target for first release
